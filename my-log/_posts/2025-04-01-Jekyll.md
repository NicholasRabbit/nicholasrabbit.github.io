Ironically, as a Java developer, I found that it is interesting to build a website based on Jekyll, which is a framework written by Ruby. 
One reason is presumably there is a thorough and user-friendly documentation; maybe there are documentation about how to build a website with Java, but, unfortunately, I haven't found any since I was always busy with writing code.

The second is that it is easy to use Jekyll.

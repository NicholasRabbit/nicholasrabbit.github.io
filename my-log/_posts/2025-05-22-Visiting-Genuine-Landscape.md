As Artificial Intellengence is becoming more and more popular, many generated video have been releasing on the Internet. 

Whereas, I was not astound by these fabulously well generated scenery which was not breathtaking at all. On the contrary,  I have subscribed some travelling and geographic channels in which considerable number of genuine pictures of steep cliffs, magnificent waterfalls, vast grassland and dense forests were published; I was intrigued in these attractions indeed. Fortunately, generated video merely appeared on the Internet so that the real world hasnâ€™t been changed. Therefore, tourists can visit these really beautiful scenery after closing computer.

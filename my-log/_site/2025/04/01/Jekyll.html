    <h1>Jekyll</h1>

<p>01 Apr 2025 - Nicholas </p>

<p>Ironically, as a Java developer, I found that it is interesting to build a website based on Jekyll, which is a framework written by Ruby. 
One reason is presumably there is a thorough and user-friendly documentation; maybe there are documentation about how to build a website with Java, but, unfortunately, I havenâ€™t found any since I was always busy with writing code.</p>

<p>The second is that it is easy to use Jekyll.</p>

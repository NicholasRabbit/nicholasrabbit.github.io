It is a long time since I wrote the last journal. In order to hand in my dissertation on time, I have to spent much time writing it. The deadline is approaching so that I have to write it day and night. If I passed the verification, I would be granted with a bachelor degree on computer science. 

The degree is extremely valuable for me. It proves that I have completed the comprehensive courses of computer science. Even though it is an online program, the degree  is as same as the one a student obtains on campus and is recognised by the Education Ministry in China. The most significant impact is that I am qualified for the jobs which need applicants at least have a bachelor degree. In fact, it is a fundamental or minimum requirement.

There are three-days vocation from today because of Qingming Festival. I took a coach home as soon as getting off work.  The ticket price is  ten RMB more than it costs in usual days, and it should be paid in advance or there is no seat left.

The good news is that today  I have found the solution to delete the cluttered code. I felt bitterly embarrassed after realising that I even didn't have found where the problem was before refactoring the programme. It is heuristic when I was trying to solve problems. First of all, donâ€™t be so hurry. Then locate the problem and do your best to solve it.

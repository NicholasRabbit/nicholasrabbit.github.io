As the most powerful democratic country in the world, US always arouse interest for what is happening in it. For the past few months, it is the presidential election that intrigues everyone. Although American society is becoming more and more polarised along with contentious contests in every four year's election, the country is growing stronger and stronger. 

Why am I so interested in the election in other countries? It's should be none of my business. Yes, of course. But don't you think that it is therapeutic, hopeful or comfortable for someone who live in a autocratic country watching countless fake news and being supressed by a notorious party to know that there are many countries where their citizens have right to vote, have privacy, have right to fire corrupt officials and have right to protect themselves? Presumably, it is my business and perhaps it is other modern slaves business. Unfortunately, we just dream a daydream because we are all cowards, including those who live in this country and who have immigrated to another country. Whereas, this kind of daydream is to some extent unique because it is real and it happens in the real world even though the participants are not us. I will still send my best wishes to them.  

As a matter of fact, the chaos, disorders and other factors in election have frustrated all the people for many years. They will find the way out as what their forebears did for democracy hundreds years ago. If they could create a democratic country from a feudal system, they can definitely protect it.

After reading a book named [Test Driven-Practical TDD and Acceptance TDD for Java Developers](https://www.manning.com/books/test-driven)  for serval days, I finally wrote a demo by following the instruction in the book. I gradually began to understand about what TDD is after reading nearly half of the book. Honestly, even though the book highly recommended, I wondered whether it was worth reading before I wrote the first demo today. 

Fortunately, I don’’t stop reading and understand why the author thoroughly write so many chapters before he  wrote the first demo. When adopting a new approach, I should know what it is and what kind of problems it will help me to solve. Writing demos at the beginning is easy, but for the readers who have not heard about TDD and develop software in a traditional way, it is confused  for them to understand it, especially writing a test first before writing any product code. That is interesting. There is no shortcut but to read the book carefully.

title:  "Focus"

Sometimes I can't focus on my job. As a matter of fact, nobody interrupts me and I just want to do many jobs at the same time. Consequently, a lot of time is wasted and I feel deeply frustrated  when the goals are not achieved.  As the host of "The Developer Tea" said, focus is essential for working effectively. It does not mean that to say yes to one thing but to say no to others things.  After all, my brain is not a multi-core processor.

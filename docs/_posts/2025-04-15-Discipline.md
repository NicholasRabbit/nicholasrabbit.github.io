When I was at college I developed rhinitis and felt splitting headache when the temperature changed drastically. Many general practitioners in my hometown had prescribed me some tablets but in vain. Ironically, I felt better only if I was have them. As a matter of fact, I couldn't have these pills all my life because they are poisonous to some extent. Fortunately, ,my friend, who also suffered excruciating pain caused by the same disease, told me that the only way to alleviate pain was to take exercises, to run and to play sports. I followed his advice and had started running in the evenings ever since if I had time whatever the weather was. 

In the autumn of 2018, I started going jogging in the evenings after work. Presumably, the pain was not eased immediately, but I kept on running. When autumn was coming I was sneezing none stop that year. Whereas, that didn't happen in the next year after I had been running for a whole year. Furthermore, there was an unexpected achievement which was that I was more disciplined than before. My immune system become stronger and I didn't have to take enormous number of tablets.

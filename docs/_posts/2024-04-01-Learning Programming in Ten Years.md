title:  "Learning Programming in Ten Years"
---

Today I read an essay in which the author harshly criticised the trend of learning programming in a few hours or a few days. The author  provided adequate proofs to challenge the view and concluded that it at least takes ten years or 10,000 hours to learn programming. As a matter of fact, a person who learns programming in a few days can only learn the basic syntax of a programming language and eventually write code which is full of bug. 

Why are so many people in such a rush? Even the talented musicians, writers and architects have to take ten years to do a good job, not to mention ordinary people. True expertise may take a lifetime. “Excellence in any department can be attained only by the labour of a lifetime; it is not to be purchased at a lesser price”, said Samuel Johnson. 

Whereas, doing a particular job for ten years doesn’t mean you can be expertise naturally. The key is deliberative practice which means you should challenge yourself with tasks that is beyond your current ability, trying it and analysing it, correcting any mistakes you make. Then repeat and repeat.

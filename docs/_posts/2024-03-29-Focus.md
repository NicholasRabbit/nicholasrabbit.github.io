title:  "Focus"
---

Sometimes I can't focus on one thing. Even though nobody interrupts me, I just want to do many things at the same time. Consequently, I made a lot of mistakes and didn't achieve any goal. I feel frustrated when a lot of time is wated. "Focus is essential for effective work." , said the host of Developer Tea, "It does not mean that to say yes to one thing but to say no to others things."  Because human's brain is not a multi-core processor thus we can't do many things at the same time.

If I had enough time, I would build my website on GitHub pages. As a programmer, it is quite convenient to build a website based on a repository in GitHub. I always write essays, journals and so forth. However, as far as I know, I should build it from scratch. There must be some templates somewhere. In order to save an middle aged man's precious time, I will find them later.

Presumably, there are grammatical errors, misspelled words and inappropriate expression in these essays, but it is acknowledged that making mistakes is inevitable when you are learning a language. Whereas, that does mean I will ignore that.

# My Page

If I had enough time, I would build my website on GitHub pages. I always write essays, journals and so forth on blogger.com. As a programmer, it is quite convenient to build a website based on a repository in GitHub.

However, as far as I know, I should build it from scratch. There must be some templates somewhere. In order to save an middle aged man's precious time, I will find them later.
